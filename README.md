# Monte Carlo Methods Project

The repository contains the final project carried out for the course on Monte Carlo Methods at Collegio Carlo Alberto (Turin).
The project is jointly written by Charif El Gataa, Maria Cristina Niero and Jerome Romano. <br>
The aim was to infer key parameters of a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model using Bayesian inference. It was accomplished by simulating the system dynamics and analyzing partial observations collected in a stable regime with Approximate Bayesian Computation Monte Carlo methods.
